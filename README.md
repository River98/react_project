The purpose of this app was an introduction to React. I tried to learn basic styling on top of more advanced components which I feel I've done fairly well. Also, adding JS to react is different from what I'm typically used to. All our HTML goes into a JS file so, instead of adding script tags, I literally have the JS in the front of the application and have it run towards the end. There are a few functions you'll see when you look at it.
